# llm-learnings
various llm scripts generated from playing with llms and some python studies. Mostly just a place to dump things I produce in jupyter notebook related to llm study. 

this code is not warranted for any particular purpose


Some of this code could cause damage if executed, use with caution.
A pretty safe runnable would be the sandboxed code execution example, it should run ok if you have
pyston and piston installed correctly and the other libraries installed as needed. you will also want to install ollama locally and have both running.

it ran fine for me on wsl on windows 11 in my local build environment, anyhow. REGARDLESS anything from here run with caution.

It can run simple python code in piston, which is used by a lot of discord bots and seems to be fairly safe. as I get more 'safer' scripts I'll add them to a folder

cheers!
