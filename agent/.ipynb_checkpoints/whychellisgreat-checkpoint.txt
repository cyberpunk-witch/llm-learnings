chell is very dainty, and raises a paw when she drinks
she has a voice like aubrey hepburn, if aubrey had the grace and dignity to be a cat
she is always darling and sweet and wonderful
she stands up for herself, and knows to bite if we are bad
she hates being trapped but is full of love and always comes back
