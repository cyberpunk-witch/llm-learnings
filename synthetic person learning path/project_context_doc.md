# Synthetic Person Project - Context Document for Future Sessions

*Created in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic) - Context preservation for multi-session project development*

## Project Overview

### Ultimate Goal
Develop a "synthetic person" - an AI system with human-like cognitive capabilities including:
- Multiple memory systems (working, episodic, semantic, long-term)
- Robust sense of identity and interior/exterior event distinction
- Creativity, goal development, and analogical reasoning
- Multi-modal processing (vision, sound, smell, taste, spatial awareness)
- Emotional responses that drive attention and memory salience
- Ability to infer motivations (others and self) from behavioral patterns
- Meta-cognitive abilities and self-reflection

### Practical Applications
- Hobby robots and robot pets
- Autonomous drones
- E-vehicle dashboards
- Other interesting robotics projects

### Hardware Constraints
- Currently limited to ser mini PC (CPU-based learning)
- No lab access, software-focused for now
- 1 hour daily study commitment

## Student Background

### Education & Experience
- **Academic**: ~Half bachelor's in computer engineering (physics/math heavy, plus random electives)
- **Professional**: 6.5 years as web developer (JavaScript/React, Java, MEAN/MERN stack)
- **Promotion path**: Dev associate → Dev IV/team lead → laid off 2 years ago
- **CS Foundation**: Data structures, algorithms, some C/C++, assembly basics, OS overview
- **Recent ML**: Kaggle ML courses 1-2, local LLM experimentation with ollama/langgraph

### Technical Skills
- **Languages**: JavaScript (strong), Java, Python (functional but needs strengthening), C/C++ (rusty)
- **Frameworks**: React, experience with ~15 programming languages briefly
- **Tools**: Git, JIRA, Docker, microk8s, AWS basics, Valgrind profiling
- **ML Experience**: Housing price prediction, neural network simulations, RAG toolchains

### Learning Preferences
- **Approach**: Prefers to work through problems independently when possible
- **Feedback Style**: Process-focused rather than general praise
- **Consistency**: Values accuracy over comfort, collaborative but direct communication
- **Problem-solving**: Wants to develop problem-solving skills rather than just get solutions

## Current Learning Path Status

### Completed Curriculum Design
1. **Overall Skill Tree**: Foundation → Cognitive Architecture → Integration layers
2. **Course 1** (6-8 weeks): Python & Neural Networks Fundamentals
3. **Course 2** (8-10 weeks): Memory Systems & Agent Architectures

### Planned Future Courses (Not Yet Developed)
- **Course 3**: Emotional Systems & Creativity
- **Course 4**: Multi-Modal Processing & Embodied AI
- **Course 5**: Self-Reflection & Metacognition
- **Course 6**: Integration & Advanced Applications

### Key Milestones Defined
- **Phase 1** (Months 1-3): Foundation building, handwriting recognition CNN
- **Phase 2** (Months 4-6): Cognitive systems, multi-modal agent with memory
- **Phase 3** (Months 7-12): Full system integration, synthetic person prototype

## Learning Philosophy & Approach

### Pedagogical Preferences
- Build from first principles before using frameworks
- Emphasize hands-on projects and practical implementation
- Balance theory with concrete deliverables
- Encourage independent problem-solving with guided support

### Assessment Strategy
- Regular checkpoints with practical deliverables
- Focus on understanding trade-offs and design decisions
- Emphasize documentation and explanation of approaches
- Build toward increasingly complex integrated systems

### Time Management
- 1 hour daily focused study/coding
- 2-3 hours weekly for larger projects
- Monthly progress reviews and path adjustments
- Quarterly major project integration

## Technical Environment

### Development Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Core Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Environment**: Jupyter notebooks or VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git for project tracking

### Resource Strategy
- Start with CPU-based implementations
- Use efficient architectures (MobileNet, DistilBERT)
- Focus on algorithmic understanding over scale
- Prepare for eventual GPU/cloud scaling

## Next Session Preparation

### Questions to Ask
1. **Progress Update**: Which course/week are you currently on?
2. **Challenges**: What concepts or implementations are you struggling with?
3. **Successes**: What has clicked well or exceeded expectations?
4. **Timeline**: How is the 1-hour daily commitment working?
5. **Interests**: Any shifts in what aspects are most appealing?
6. **Hardware**: Any changes to available computing resources?

### Potential Adaptations
- **Pacing**: Adjust timeline based on actual progress
- **Focus Areas**: Shift emphasis based on interests and challenges
- **Resources**: Update links and materials based on what works
- **Projects**: Modify project complexity based on skill development

### Context Validation
Since this is a new chat session, verify:
- Current position in learning path
- Any major changes to goals or constraints
- New interests or priority shifts
- Technical environment changes
- Time availability updates

## Important Notes

### Collaboration Style
- Ask before providing complete solutions for design/engineering problems
- Check if student wants to work through problems independently
- Focus on process-oriented feedback rather than general praise
- Point out inconsistencies and expect the same in return
- Clarify ambiguous requests rather than making assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Remember hardware limitations when suggesting approaches
- Prioritize educational value over computational efficiency
- Build toward eventual robotics applications
- Maintain connection between theoretical learning and practical goals

### Success Metrics
- **Technical**: Can implement core algorithms from scratch
- **Conceptual**: Can explain cognitive architectures and interactions
- **Practical**: Can build working prototypes of key capabilities
- **Creative**: Can design novel approaches to cognitive challenges

## Future Development Areas

### Immediate Next Steps (Course 3+)
- Emotional and motivational systems
- Creativity and imagination mechanisms
- Advanced human-AI interaction
- Self-reflection and metacognitive abilities

### Long-term Integration Challenges
- Balancing multiple cognitive systems
- Real-time performance optimization
- Robustness and error handling
- Scaling to more complex environments

### Potential Pivot Points
- Hardware upgrade opportunities
- Shift toward specific robotics applications
- Deeper focus on particular cognitive abilities
- Integration with external robotics platforms
