# Synthetic Person Development - Skill Tree & Learning Path

*Collaboratively developed with Claude (Anthropic) - AI assistant contribution to curriculum design and structuring*

## Overview
This learning path is designed to build towards creating a "synthetic person" - an AI system with human-like cognitive capabilities including memory, reasoning, creativity, and emotional responses. The path balances theoretical understanding with practical implementation.
