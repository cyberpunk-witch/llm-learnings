Since the user is asking about plants in season in Portland, I should acknowledge their curiosity and provide information.\n",

Portland, OR, has a temperate climate, so the seasons are a bit different from the equatorial regions. The seasons are not as distinct as in places like the US Midwest. In Portland, the seasons are more like a transitional period between spring and fall.\n",

Summer: roses, lavender, peonies, marigolds, zinnias. Fall: leaves changing, maple and oak trees, fireflies, ferns, holly. Winter: evergreens, pine trees, snow, and the occasional plant that blooms in winter like some types of bulbs.\n",

      "I need to make sure the information is accurate. Portland's climate is influenced by the Pacific Ocean, so the seasons are milder. The spring bloom is earlier than in other regions, and the fall colors are more vivid. Also, some plants might not be in season due to the coastal climate, like certain types of flowers that require more heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any specific plants the user is interested in, but since they didn't specify, keep it general. Maybe add a note about the importance of checking local sources for the most up-to-date information. Also, offer to help with more details if they need.\n",

      "  - **Bloomers:** Cherry blossoms, tulips, daffodils, crocuses, and early-blooming rhododendrons.  \n",
      "  - **Evergreens:** Japanese maples, red oaks, and pine trees start showing leaf buds.  \n",
      "  - **Flowers:** Marigolds, zinnias, and some hyacinths (though later than usual).  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Summer (Juneâ€“August):**  \n",
      "  - **Roses, lavender, peonies, and marigolds** thrive in the warm, coastal climate.  \n",

      "\n",
      "- **Winter (Decemberâ€“February):**  \n",
      "  - **Evergreens** like pines and firs dominate, while **snow** blankets the landscape.  \n",
      "  - **Bulbs** (e.g., snowdrops) may bloom in early winter, though itâ€™s less common than in other regions.  \n",
