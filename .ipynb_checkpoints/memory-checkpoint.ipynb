    "ai writing tells: 1. Use of em dash. 2. use of 'not only' or 'but also' or 'not just' 3. use of groups of 3 in writing. 4. bulleted lists using emojis instead of bullets. 5. The use of 'safe' avocabulary and jargon - nonspecific indirect language which lacks concreteness. Words like 'elevate' and 'delve'. Uplifting, positive vocabulary. 6. bland, disingenuous sounding, generic praise. 7. Use of overly formal communicate in non-formal contexts. 8. poor analogies and similarities that don't fit a scenario well or feel unnatural. 9. over-explanation, unnecessary clarification, oxymoronic and repetitive writing.  10. words, stories and anecdotes are too generic - avoiding the use of personal examples. rarely uses phrases like, \"as a <x>\", \"personally\", etc. 10. a lack of tangents, which humans often use to be illustrative of a point. 11. Humans sometimes use vulnerability to reduce tension when writing, sharing embarrassing details about themselves and the like. we also sometimes say things which are mildly inappropriate or antisocial in order to bond over shared annoyances, and to show that we're not afraid to speak up for ourselves - at least in private. moreover our writing serves not just to communicate but to attempt to influence the emotional state of the reader - such as to persuade them to get angry about a political situation, or to like you, or to annoy you, or amuse you - but keeping it subtle and not being too 'aggressively' persuasive. 12. humans also use humor to diffuse tension and making a joke in response to things getting tense is sometimes a good way to defuse. other more grave situations - like tragedies - require solemnity.
